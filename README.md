# Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines

This project is part of the [DrivenData Flu Shot Learning competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/). 

The purpose of this project is to predict the likelihood of subjects having been vaccinated with both the H1N1 flu vaccine as well as the seasonal flu vaccine in late 2009 and early 2010 based off of answers to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
